The recommendation comes as the country’s civil aviation regulator ANAC has announced it will take back the slots held by grounded airline Avianca Brasil in the airport, known as Congonhas, as part of a plan to redistribute them later.   Under current rules, many of the slots would go to the two airlines that already control most of Congonhas’ flights: Gol Linhas Aereas Inteligentes  and LATAM Airlines Group .   The antitrust regulator, known as CADE, wants the rules changed to favor potential new entrants, increasing competition, according to a legal recommendation made public on Monday.   The Brazilian government recently enacted a law that allows foreign-owned carriers to operate domestic flights in Latin America’s largest air market, which could unleash new competition for the Congonhas slots.   The timing is significant because Congonhas slots are not normally up for grabs. But Avianca Brasil’s financial crisis has changed that landscape. Formerly Brazil’s No. 4 airline, the carrier has been grounded since May following a bankruptcy filing and the progressive reduction of its operations.   Its financial struggles set off a fierce battle over who would inherit its slots, particularly in Congonhas and the domestic airport in Rio de Janeiro. Brazil’s top three airlines, Gol, LATAM and Azul SA, had all expressed interest in the slots, and spent millions in efforts to secure them.   Avianca Brasil had planned to auction the slots on July 10, in hopes of raising at least $140 million for its creditors. But with ANAC’s decision to recall the slots, it is unclear whether the auction will still take place.  A representative for Avianca Brasil did not have immediate comment.

Crude inventories rose 2.1 million barrels in the week to April 15, compared with analysts’ expectations for an increase of 2.4 million barrels. Crude stocks at the Cushing, Oklahoma, delivery hub for U.S. crude futures fell 248,000 barrels, EIA said. Brent and U.S. crude futures both rose after the data, with Brent reversing losses and turning positive. [O/R] “Distillates are the standout bullish element of the report and gasoline is the disappointment,” said Matt Smith, director of commodity research at New York-headquartered energy data provider ClipperData. “Distillate throughput jumped last week, meaning demand is only down 0.7 percent on the 4-week moving average.” Distillate stockpiles, which include diesel and heating oil, fell 3.6 million barrels, versus expectations for a 304,000-barrel increase, the EIA data showed. “This pocket of demand might be a bright spot in terms of helping to sop up some of the global glut of diesel,” said David Thompson, executive vice-president at energy-specialized commodities broker Powerhouse in Washington. Gasoline stocks fell 110,000 barrels, far less than the 1.2 million-barrel drawdown forecast. Refinery crude runs rose 163,000 barrels per day, as utilization rates inched up 0.2 percentage point to 89.4 percent of total capacity. U.S. crude imports rose 247,000 bpd. “PADD 3 crude stocks unchanged on a modestly large reduction in imports into P3 and a reduction in run rates in P3,” said Dominick Chirichella, senior partner at the Energy Management Institute in New York.

      "3    Brazil bridge collapse could affect grain shipments in north SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Part of a bridge over the Moju River in Brazil’s Para state collapsed early on Saturday, potentially affecting shipment of grains such as soybeans and corn through northern ports, local authorities and an agribusiness consultant said. The bridge fell after it was hit by a boat, Governor Helder Barbalho said on Twitter, where he also posted videos of a large section of the bridge in the water. He said this was not the first time such an accident had occurred. According to the official Agência Brasil news agency, two vehicles were crossing the bridge at the time of the collision. “At the moment, our priority is searching for victims and giving complete support to their families,” Barbalho was quoted as saying in a statement from Para’s state news agency. According to rescue workers, no crew or documents from the boat that collided against the bridge were found on the scene. The number of casualties was unclear. Kory Melby, an agribusiness consultant based in the city of Goiania, said the bridge was on the main route connecting Brazil’s farm country to its northern ports. “It will probably take years for that bridge to be rebuilt,” he said by telephone. The consultant noted the bridge was located some 50 kilometers (31 miles) from Belém, capital of Pará state, where three major grain loaders operate, including Archer Daniels Midland Co, Bunge Ltd and Hidrovias do Brasil SA. The companies did not immediately reply to requests for comment. Melby said barge traffic would not be affected on the Tocantins and Amazon rivers, which use river ports including Vila do Conde and Barcarena. Some 10 to 20 percent of the soy grown in Brazil’s center west is delivered by road at those ports, he said. Willians Ribeiro, a supervisor at Vila do Conde, told Reuters road traffic to that port would be affected but there were alternative routes. Shipping statistics show some 5.7 million tonnes of soybeans and 3 million tonnes of corn were unloaded in 2018 in the region, a volume likely to increase due to port expansions, according to the consultant.

They’re a team that wants to win the Stanley Cup real bad and so do I.” Staal, 33, says he has spoken briefly with general manager Paul Fenton about a new contract, but that they agreed to get the season underway first. Staal is entering the final season of his three-year contract. Envisioning a run at the NHL title is the difference between this season and three seasons ago, when he was finishing up a contract with the Carolina Hurricanes, who weren’t expected to be a factor in the postseason. The Hurricanes dealt him to the New York Rangers in February 2016. “This is a team that expects to win,” Staal said. “That makes it a different situation just for me, my own mental side. In Carolina, I could see the writing on the wall and it was one of those things where we were kind of methodically going through the months to get to the point where it was time for me to move on. It doesn’t have that same feel.” Staal, a center, scored 42 goals last season, just three off his career high, which came in his second season with the Hurricanes in 2005-06. His 76 points were tied for third-best in his 14 seasons. The Hurricanes selected Staal second overall in the 2003 draft. In 909 games, he has 775 points on 322 goals and 453 assists. —Field Level Media\n",

Earlier this month, Group Mach made a formal proposal for Transat, topping an offer from the country’s largest airline Air Canada.

Excluding volatile car sales, “core” retail sales volumes grew by 0.8 percent compared to the previous month to stand 4 percent higher on the year. The monthly fall in the headline figure was driven by a fall in motor trade, which was down 3.9 percent in August after a spike in July due to a customer rush to buy cars with the latest registrations.

The reported problems specifically involve users seeing their iPhones automatically shut off despite 50-60 percent battery levels, and the involuntary shutting off in room temperature or colder environments, as well as the inability to turn the cellphone back on despite continuous battery charging, the statement said. “In view that Apple iPhone 6 and iPhone 6s series cellphones in China have a considerable number of users, and the number of people who’ve reported this problem is rather many, China Consumer Association has already made a query with Apple,” the association said in a statement on its website. Apple did not respond to a request for comment when contacted outside regular hours on Tuesday. In September Apple’s rival phone maker Samsung Electronics Co announced a global recall of at least 2.5 million of its flagship Note 7 smartphones due to faulty batteries causing some phones to catch fire.

      "25    Close Brexit polls worrying, says Siemens UK chief LIVERPOOL, England (Reuters) - Siemens UK Chief Executive Juergen Maier, a prominent supporter of Britain’s membership of the European Union, said on Monday he was worried by opinion polls showing the country’s EU referendum is likely to go down to the wire. With 10 days to go before Britons vote on whether to remain a member of the 28-country bloc, polls show that a slim early lead for the “In” campaign has evaporated in recent weeks, leaving public opinion split roughly down the middle. Maier said he had been scrutinizing the polls closely and believed it was now neck and neck between the two campaigns. “Absolutely I’m worried, because it’s clear it’s going to be close and I really want to see the outcome that I believe is best for Britain,” he told Reuters on the sidelines of an international business festival in Liverpool, northern England. Maier has openly campaigned for Britain to stay in the EU, including appearances alongside Prime Minister David Cameron. He argued the bloc gives Britain international influence, supports research and development and supports investor confidence. Rival “Out” campaigners say that leaving the EU would grant Britain greater control over its economy and the freedom to cut its own international trade deals. Maier criticized the campaign so far, saying it had become a “media-rich, hysterical debate”. He said there had been too much focus from both sides on arguments being made by politicians, and not enough of the views of business and other communities. “The campaign unfortunately has just become too polarized - it hasn’t provided that calm rational debate that’s needed,” he said.

Almost all train, bus and tram drivers in the Netherlands staged a 24-hour strike on Tuesday, protesting over proposed reforms of the country’s pension system. Airline KLM had advised passengers to postpone their travel plans and offered them the opportunity to reschedule flights to another date free of charge. Britain’s EasyJet canceled 24 flights after the airport had asked airlines to limit the number of passengers coming to Schiphol as much as possible. Other operators to cancel flights and offer alternative travel dates were United Airlines, Flybe and Ryanair. The strikes, which led to large traffic jams around major Dutch cities early on Tuesday, are part of larger protests, which are expected to lead to walk-outs in factories and amongst public services workers on Wednesday. Unions are demanding the government drops its plans to increase the retirement age and cap it at its current level of 66 as well as making it easier for people with physically demanding jobs to stop working earlier.

Raonic, 26, has posted a 28-11 mark in 2017. He is the fourth notable player to recently pull out, joining Switzerland’s Roger Federer (back), Scotland’s Andy Murray (hip) and Croatia’s Marin Cilic (adductor).

The bridge fell after it was hit by a boat, Governor Helder Barbalho said on Twitter, where he also posted videos of a large section of the bridge in the water. He said this was not the first time such an accident had occurred. According to the official Agência Brasil news agency, two vehicles were crossing the bridge at the time of the collision. “At the moment, our priority is searching for victims and giving complete support to their families,” Barbalho was quoted as saying in a statement from Para’s state news agency. According to rescue workers, no crew or documents from the boat that collided against the bridge were found on the scene. The number of casualties was unclear. Kory Melby, an agribusiness consultant based in the city of Goiania, said the bridge was on the main route connecting Brazil’s farm country to its northern ports. “It will probably take years for that bridge to be rebuilt,” he said by telephone. The consultant noted the bridge was located some 50 kilometers (31 miles) from Belém, capital of Pará state, where three major grain loaders operate, including Archer Daniels Midland Co, Bunge Ltd and Hidrovias do Brasil SA. The companies did not immediately reply to requests for comment. Melby said barge traffic would not be affected on the Tocantins and Amazon rivers, which use river ports including Vila do Conde and Barcarena. Some 10 to 20 percent of the soy grown in Brazil’s center west is delivered by road at those ports, he said. Willians Ribeiro, a supervisor at Vila do Conde, told Reuters road traffic to that port would be affected but there were alternative routes. Shipping statistics show some 5.7 million tonnes of soybeans and 3 million tonnes of corn were unloaded in 2018 in the region, a volume likely to increase due to port expansions, according to the consultant.

National Geographic reported Friday that the maroon and gold creature, which was discovered 300 feet deep in the waters off Kure Atoll, is the only known fish to live within Papahānaumokuākea, an expanse of coral reefs and seamounts home to more than 7,000 species.  One looking for the fish's official name, however, is likely to stay hooked -- a formal description of the species isn't expected to be published until later this year. Last week, Obama established the largest protected marine sanctuary in the world when he more than quadrupled the size of the Papahānaumokuākea Marine National Monument to protect reefs, marine life habitats and other resources. The expansion will add 442,781 square miles to the monument, making it now a total of 582,578 square miles. The dorsal fin coloration of the male is a circular red spot ringed with blue which scientists said reminded them of Obama's campaign logo. \"It's very reminiscent of Obama's (campaign) logo,\" Richard Pyle, a marine biologist, told the magazine. \"How appropriate that a fish we were thinking about naming after him anyway, just to say thank you for expanding the national monument, happens to have a feature that ties it to the President.\" The species was discovered this past June during a research trip to Kure, the world's northernmost atoll, National Geographic reported.

This is not the first time Obama has had a fish named after him. Scientists named an aqua and orange speckled freshwater darter found in the Tennessee River Etheostoma Obama in 2012. At the time, scientists named others of the more than 200 species of darters discovered after other presidents.  \n",

Thiel, who was born in Germany and has citizenship there and in the U.S., petitioned for New Zealand citizenship citing \"exceptional circumstances\" that would be in the public interest. Taking into consideration Thiel's track record — which includes cofounding PayPal, backing New Zealand company Xero, contributing money for the development of a local fiber optic cable, investing early in Facebook and donating to an earthquake relief fund — and his interest in supporting New Zealand entrepreneurs, New Zealand's Department of Internal Affairs ultimately granted his request for citizenship in 2011. But Thiel did not meet all requirements for New Zealand citizenship. Having received permanent residence in the country in 2007, he was supposed to have spent at least 1,350 days there in the five years leading up to his citizenship application, according to documents made available under the country's Official Information Act. Additionally, New Zealand law required Thiel to intend to continue to reside in New Zealand or work outside the country for an approved organization, such as a New Zealand company. But Thiel \"has stated that, if granted citizenship, he would continue to reside there (in the U.S.) to manage his American companies,\" one document states. The government officials pointed to multiple instances of Thiel looking to do more in New Zealand. For example, they noted that Thiel representatives talked with New Zealand's Ministry of Science and Innovation officials about forming a technology company incubator in the city of Auckland, as well as a San Francisco \"landing pad\" for New Zealand entrepreneurs going to the U.S. \"As a world-class entrepreneur Mr. Thiel believes that with the right support New Zealand can achieve a place at the top of the world's list of best countries for entrepreneurs,\" the Department of Internal Affairs officials wrote. Thiel is a cofounder of Founders Fund, which has invested in Airbnb, Lyft, Spotify and Stripe, among other companies. He is also an advisor to President Donald Trump. A Founders Fund representative did not respond to a request for comment.\n",
      "26    Accenture's Julie Sweet: Why this CEO keeps coming back to Davos Davos, Switzerland (CNN Business)Julie Sweet, the CEO of Accenture North America, is on her fifth Davos.  Some things, she says, never change at the World Economic Forum. The tempo is frenetic, and each day is packed full of meetings and events.  What does vary are the topics of discussion. This year, conversations revolved around trust in technology, the weakening global economy and geopolitical issues such as Brexit. And that's why Sweet says she keeps coming back to the Swiss mountains. \"There's no alternative that allows those conversations to happen as broadly as has happened in Davos,\" Sweet said. Davos has been criticized as an elite gathering that's disconnected from real-world challenges. But Sweet said that discussions here tie back directly to anxieties and concerns at home. \"You are bringing together, in one place, leaders of some of the top companies in the world to talk about those topics,\" she said.  Here's Sweet's take on the big issues that dominated the forum this year. The economy There has \"certainly\" been a lot of public discussion around the uptick in market volatility and economic uncertainty, according to Sweet. But in her private conversations with about a dozen chief executives, it hasn't been a major concern. \"The topic of the conversation is not whether there's an impending economic slowdown,\" Sweet said. \"It remains very focused on the competitive environment.\" Companies have been operating in an environment of low growth for some time, she added. Gender Just 22% of Davos participants this year were women. That's an increase of 1 percentage point from last year. Sweet said there's been more of a focus on gender equality every year, and that spaces like the Female Quotient lounge, which is sponsored by Deloitte, JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Twitter (TWTR) and others, have helped. Looking at the gender breakdown of the forum, Sweet was pragmatic. \"We know that there are still not that many women in the C-Suite relative to men,\" she said. \"And this is a CEO conference.\"  The US government shutdown Accenture has a federal consulting business, and some of its employees have been affected by the 35-day government shutdown, Sweet said. The employees who aren't working are \"ready to go\" as soon as it ends, she said. A spokesperson for Accenture said that these employees have been moved to other projects or are in skills training during the shutdown. Climate risks Climate and environmental issues dominated a ranking of top global risks produced by the World Economic Forum. But Sweet said she hasn't seen much focus on the report. \"That has not come up this week,\" she said. That doesn't mean climate and sustainability weren't discussed at all. There were several related panel discussions and other events.  \"I think there is a general view that sustainability is really important,\" she said, adding that it affects business operations and public trust. \"I do think it is a top priority. I don't know that it's the top priority.\" Trust in technology Accenture's big theme at Davos was building trust in technology. \"Trust is the ultimate currency,\" read a sign outside the company's lounge. \"We've really seen a shift in both the competitive landscape, and just how companies are thinking about digital,\" Sweet said. \"[They're saying], 'Digital is clearly critical, and if we don't get the trust equation right, we're not going to be able to drive our growth.'\" Sweet spent a lot of time this week talking about declining trust in the internet, and how that touches all businesses. \"This is about the seismic shift toward every business across industries being digital, and what comes along with that,\" she said. \n",

Trump had previously touted Saudi Arabia's financial contribution, telling Fox News last week, \"I said, listen, you're a very rich country. You want more troops? I'm going to send them to you, but you've got to pay us. They're paying us. They've already deposited $1 billion in the bank.\" But the Pentagon says discussions about how Saudi Arabia can help pay for the cost of the US military deployment there are ongoing. \"The Saudi government has agreed to contribute to the costs of these activities, and discussions are ongoing to formalize these contributions. Contributions of this nature do not lead to the deployment of additional U.S. forces, and they do not drive DOD to take on new missions or responsibilities,\" Pentagon spokesperson Cmdr. Rebecca Rebarich told CNN in a statement. \"While we will not comment on specific bilateral defense agreements, more broadly the United States encourages burden-sharing among partners in support of shared security interests, to include defense of the Arabian Gulf,\" a State Department official said. The US has deployed thousands of additional US troops and missile defense batteries to Saudi Arabia in response to what Pentagon officials have said is an increased threat from Iran. The US and several European nations have blamed Iran for a missile attack that targeted Saudi energy facilities, temporarily affecting the country's ability to produce oil. The military buildup has come despite Trump repeatedly claiming that he wants to reduce the US military commitment in the Middle East, a pledge that he cited when he ordered the reduction of US troops in Syria, a move that received broad bipartisan opposition in Congress, as many lawmakers see it as an abandonment of America's partner in the fight against ISIS, the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces. Asked about Trump's comments Secretary of Defense Mark Esper said the payments the President referenced were referring to the concept of \"burden sharing.\" \"Burden sharing comes in many forms,\" Esper told CBS on Sunday, later adding that \"it includes host nation support. It includes foreign military cells. It includes providing troops on the ground, and, in cases, it provides helping to offset some of our operations maintenance costs, which the Saudis are committed to doing, just as they did offset costs during the 1990 and '91 Gulf War.\" Saudi Arabia has also not reimbursed the US for the cost of aerial refueling operations that the US military provided to Saudi warplanes. The US stopped providing aerial refueling to Saudi jets participating in its campaign against Houthi rebels in Yemen in November of 2018. In December of 2018 the US military said it was seeking a $331 million reimbursement from Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates after discovering it had failed to properly charge the Saudi-led coalition fighting in Yemen for aerial refueling services. More than a year later, the Saudis have still not paid that bill. \"The process of reimbursement is ongoing and we continue to expect full reimbursement of refueling expenses. I am not going to be able to provide specifics on the reimbursement process,\" Rebarich, the Pentagon spokesperson, told CNN. CNN's Jennifer Hansler contributed to this report.\n",

The lawsuit, filed in New York state court in Albany, is over “Cra-Z-Jewelz” jewelry-making kits that were imported by LaRose and sold by Target and Walmart. Tests conducted by the attorney general’s office found that the kits contained levels of lead that were up to 10 times higher than the federal limit, according to the complaint. Although the kits were recalled, the complaint says the companies failed to take “measures sufficient to ensure that they do not again import, distribute, and sell toys that place New York children at risk of adverse health consequences from lead exposure.” The lawsuit seeks civil penalties collectively ranging from $70 to $6,000 for each “Cra-Z-Jewelz” kit the companies sought to sell in New York. It also seeks an order directing LaRose and Target, when it acts as an importer, to implement a quality control program for overseas manufacturing operations and a testing program for lead levels, and seeks a separate order directing that Target and Walmart, as retailers, confirm compliance certificates for toys imported for sale in New York and a testing program for lead levels. Walmart said it removed the toys from its shelves and online as soon as LaRose informed the recall nearly three years ago and it did not sell the products thereafter. “We’ve discussed this matter with the New York Attorney General’s office and will address the allegations and demands with the court,” a Walmart spokesman said. Target said it stopped selling the toy in April 2016 immediately after the New York Attorney General informed them about the problems with the product. LaRose did not respond to Reuters requests for comment. Reporting by Aishwarya Venugopal in Bengaluru and Nandita Bose in New York; Editing by Leslie Adler\n",

Pope Francis would like to heal a decades-old rift with China, where Catholics are divided between those loyal to him and those who belong to a government-controlled official church. In June, China said it opposed outside interference in its internal affairs after the Vatican expressed concern about a Chinese bishop it said had been “removed”. Speaking in Beijing where he was attending an organ transplant conference, the head of the Vatican’s Pontifical Academy of Sciences, Monsignor Marcelo Sanchez Sorondo, expressed the Pope’s goodwill, the state-run Global Times reported. “Pope Francis loves China and loves the people of China, its history and population. We hope China can have a great future,” the paper quoted him as saying. In February, China’s Foreign Ministry downplayed the significance of a top health official’s attendance at a Vatican conference on organ trafficking, saying it probably had nothing to do with two-way ties. One obstacle to better relations is the question of who should make senior clerical appointments in China. China says bishops must be named by the Chinese Catholic community and refuses to accept the authority of the pope, whom it sees as the head of a foreign state that has no right to meddle in China’s affairs. The two sides have been at loggerheads since the expulsion of foreign missionaries from China after the Communists took power in 1949. Another source of friction is the Vatican’s maintenance of official ties with self-ruled Taiwan, which Beijing sees as a wayward province to be taken back by force if necessary.

Marsha Blackburn will win the race to represent Tennessee in the US Senate, CNN can project, outlasting a challenge from former Gov. Phil Bredesen, a Democrat who looked to run against his party to win in a state President Donald Trump won by 26 percentage points in 2016. Blackburn, a conservative lawmaker closely tied to the President, looked to nationalize the Senate race as much as possible, hoping to tap into the same conservatism that elected Trump in order to blunt some goodwill Bredesen had built up during his two terms as governor. Trump visited the state three times. Blackburn will be the first female senator to represent her state. Democrats had hoped to pick up Tennessee as part of a narrow path to retaking the Senate. Although Bredesen ran as a Democrat, he largely ran away from the national party and regularly touted his ties to the state and independence from Washington, D.C. The strategy was clear: He hoped to bank on the fact he won every county in the state in 2006 during his second run for governor and looked to tag Blackburn as a traditional Washington ideologue. Bredesen got some help, too. Sen. Bob Corker, whose decision to retire opened the seat and gave way to the Democratic campaign, declined to help bury the popular Democrat, a clear sign that not all Republicans have been wooed by the Trump wing of the party. And the former governor also energized Tennessee Democrats who had long struggled to gain traction in the state. Taylor Swift, a pop star known for staying out of politics, eagerly got behind his campaign, too. Blackburn, however, looked to highlight Bredesen's party affiliation at every turn, regularly tying him to Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and some of the more high-profile liberal members of the legislative body. \"Phil Bredesen has said he would have voted against the tax cuts,\" Blackburn said during one debate. \"Chuck Schumer has bought and paid for his campaign.\" Bredesen looked to blunt the attack by telling voters he would not back Schumer for Majority Leader if he were elected. The former governor also announced during the campaign that he would have voted in favor of Brett Kavanaugh, President Donald Trump's controversial Supreme Court pick, whose confirmation hearings became a national event after professor Christine Blasey Ford testified that Kavanaugh had sexually assaulted her in high school. Kavanaugh denied the allegations. \n",

Benchmark venture capitalist Bill Gurley, who has since left Uber’s board, said that before the company acquired a startup founded by a former Waymo engineer in 2016, board members were told that due diligence on the company “had turned up nothing.” Alphabet Inc’s (GOOGL.O) Waymo sued Uber Technologies Inc [UBER.UL] a year ago, accusing it of theft of self-driving car trade secrets. Waymo said that one of the company’s former engineers, Anthony Levandowski, downloaded more than 14,000 confidential files containing designs for autonomous vehicles before Uber acquired his startup, Otto. The trial could influence one of the most important and potentially lucrative races in Silicon Valley - to create fleets of self-driving cars. Gurley’s recollection is different with former Uber CEO Travis Kalanick, who testified on Wednesday that he never read a due diligence report prepared by an outside firm that determined Levandowski did possess Alphabet data. Kalanick denied telling the board that diligence on Levandowski had come back “clean.” As part of the Otto acquisition, Uber indemnified Levandowski and his team against any future lawsuits filed by Waymo over trade-secret theft. In a brief appearance on the witness stand on Thursday, Gurley said he could not say for sure who from Uber management assured the board, but recalled that Kalanick led the majority of the presentation. He called the indemnification agreement “atypical.” “We as a group made the decision to move forward because the diligence was OK,” Gurley said in court on Thursday. He also said “as far as I know” no trade secrets came from Waymo to Uber. The trial is expected to continue through next week. The jury will have to decide whether the documents downloaded by Levandowski were indeed trade secrets and not common knowledge, and whether Uber improperly acquired them, used them and benefited from them.

The redesigned potato chip bag and new logo give Lay's its first new look in 12 years.  Unlike previous redesigns, Lay's isn't undergoing a radical transformation. Instead, the refreshed logo and packaging are meant to make the brand feel more modern and contemporary, said Jon Guerra, senior director of design at Frito-Lay.  The new logo is smaller and centralized with radiating rings. The font is slightly different, with a cursive \"y\" and a somewhat smaller \"L.\"  The biggest change to Lay's potato chip bags is the photography: The view of the chips is now shown from a \"top-down\" angle -- an homage to the rise of food photographers on social media, said Guerra. The redesign, which took two years to complete, is an attempt to keep the brand relevant in the era of social media and content regeneration, according to Guerra. \"We wanted to convey with color photography and a logo refresh that Lay's is a joyful and flavorful brand,\" Guerra said.  Lay's will first launch its global redesign in the US and Canada before taking it to other countries. The new logo will be placed on 115 Lay's products across more than 25 flavor varieties.  The Lay's brand was founded in 1932. Previous packages have featured a cartoon potato, a red and yellow spider-web design, and various shapes and sizes. The company is now owned by PepsiCo (PEP). \n",

                                Wild C Staal awaiting contract talks after season begins Eric Staal, Minnesota’s leading scorer a season ago, is eager to talk with the Wild about a long-term future with the team. “I’ve let it be known that I’ve enjoyed it and I’d like to stay,” Staal said during the NHL Player Media Tour on Thursday. “I think it’s a great fit for me hockey-wise. They’re a team that wants to win the Stanley Cup real bad and so do I.” Staal, 33, says he has spoken briefly with general manager Paul Fenton about a new contract, but that they agreed to get the season underway first. Staal is entering the final season of his three-year contract. Envisioning a run at the NHL title is the difference between this season and three seasons ago, when he was finishing up a contract with the Carolina Hurricanes, who weren’t expected to be a factor in the postseason. The Hurricanes dealt him to the New York Rangers in February 2016. “This is a team that expects to win,” Staal said. “That makes it a different situation just for me, my own mental side. In Carolina, I could see the writing on the wall and it was one of those things where we were kind of methodically going through the months to get to the point where it was time for me to move on. It doesn’t have that same feel.” Staal, a center, scored 42 goals last season, just three off his career high, which came in his second season with the Hurricanes in 2005-06. His 76 points were tied for third-best in his 14 seasons. The Hurricanes selected Staal second overall in the 2003 draft. In 909 games, he has 775 points on 322 goals and 453 assists. —Field Level Media\n",

to bare (so to speak) on the new cover of Vogue Australia. The 21-year-old beauty mogul graced the September issue wearing a black long-sleeve jacket and a super fresh-faced makeup look. Makeup artist Ariel shared a photo of the cover, noting that he would love to claim the credit for her makeup, “but it’s really ‘moisturizer by Ariel’,” referring to the pared-down beauty look she’s sporting. It’s a surprising look, considering Kylie’s makeup line, Kylie Cosmetics, just earned her a Forbes cover in recognition of the fact that the brand’s on track to be worth a billion dollars in the near future. In the accompanying interview, conducted by her sister Kendall, Kylie shared some insight into how the brand became such a phenomenon. “My Lip Kits started with, number one, my obsession with make-up and lips specifically and just how I took my insecurity with my lips and turned it into my business model,” she said. “Something I just became obsessed with was lips and lipstick, and how wearing lipstick made me feel. I just loved bigger lips, and I just got obsessed. To this day, I can’t leave the house without lipstick. So, I just think I’m obsessed with doing my make-up and watching tutorials and that’s kind of how Kylie Cosmetics started.” When Kendall questioned whether her fixation with her lips stemmed from being in the spotlight, Kylie said no. “I think I would’ve done the same thing, because my insecurity with my lips didn’t stem from people saying anything,” she said. “I don’t even think anyone commented on my lips. We all have insecurities, right? Nobody’s perfect, and that’s my thing.” She’s since started reducing the filler in her lips and has stepped out of the spotlight somewhat, currently focusing on being a new mom to new baby Stormi Webster and expanding her business ventures by taking the brand worldwide.\n",

And yet, one of the most gasp-worthy moments was hearing the tween actor Jacob Tremblay use the F-word in the first five minutes of “Good Boys.” It wouldn’t be the only time in this comedy about a wild day in the life of a few sixth-graders, and it was one of several breakout titles worth knowing about as the film portion of the festival comes to a close on Saturday. “If I’m being honest, I am shocked and appalled,” Tremblay joked during the post-screening Q.& A., and added referring to his director Gene Stupnitsky, “Gene told me this was going to be a PG-rated family movie. He lied.” The movie was right at home at a festival that has turned into something of a testing ground for the hit potential of Hollywood comedies. The audience applauded the comic timing of Tremblay and his co-stars, Brady Noon and the scene-stealing Keith L. Williams, and that positive reaction along with a recently released red-band trailer featuring one of the movie’s producers, Seth Rogen, has fueled social-media interest. “Good Boys” opens nationwide in August. Another talker was Olivia Wilde’s directing debut, “Booksmart.” Much like “Good Boys,” it follows students on a wild day, but this one is female-focused. Beanie Feldstein and Kaitlyn Dever star as high school seniors who, on the last day of school, realize they may have studied too hard and partied too softly. They make up for that in one outrageous evening that includes drugged strawberries and a raucous graduation bash. The packed house at the Paramount theater especially appreciated the killer soundtrack and a high laugh-per-minute ratio. Also winning over festivalgoers was “Long Shot,” a rom-com starring Rogen and Charlize Theron. The crowd was drawn to the combination of smart and slapstick humor, and was also roused by a Boyz II Men cameo. Then, after the screening, could it really happen? Or do dreams just fade away? The pop group did a little East Coast swing in a surprise performance. The laughs had a mellower edge at the premiere of the Harmony Korine comedy “The Beach Bum,” starring Matthew McConaughey as Moondog, the pothead writer he may have been born to play. The crowd basked in the movie’s hazy glow, and McConaughey was a great sport, attending the after-party dressed in character. Critical reaction to the film was a little more mixed. Variety wrote, “The question here isn’t if McConaughey is having fun, but whether audiences will find his laid-back, ever-lit persona nearly as entertaining to watch.” And The Hollywood Reporter said that the film was “high on style, if not substance.” Humor was also a thread through some of the festival’s darker films, including Jordan Peele’s “Us,” which opened SXSW and featured a measured number of laugh- and shriek-worthy sequences. Similarly, audiences winced and laughed during “The Art of Self-Defense,” starring Jesse Eisenberg in a deadpan role as an accountant who is brutally attacked by masked assailants. Taking classes at a dojo, he meets a sensei (Alessandro Nivola) with a tainted worldview. The comedy is pitch-black, but the crowd appreciated its sinister quirks. Other funny journeys down twisted roads included “Porno,” a 1992-set film about conservative Christian teenagers working in a small-town movie theater. After discovering an old film hidden in the walls, they inadvertently unleash a sex demon that wreaks havoc. Keola Racela’s debut feature, with more than one instance of genital mutilation played for laughs, made festivalgoers squirm but got them talking as well. “Villains,” directed by Dan Berk and Robert Olsen, put a fun twist on the home-invasion genre, with Bill Skarsgard and Maika Monroe as criminals on the lam. When their car runs out of gas, they pick the wrong home to break into, that of a couple (Jeffrey Donovan and Kyra Sedgwick) with a few skeletons in their closet and another secret in their basement. And in keeping with the Boys/Boyz festival motif, there was “Boyz in the Wood,” a hallucinogenic comedy-survival tale from the music video director Ninian Doff about teenagers in the Scottish Highlands who become more hunted than hunters. The site Film School Rejects described it as “‘Hot Fuzz’ meets ‘Attack the Block.’” The movie was the subject of so much chatter that SXSW added an extra screening. The festival wasn’t entirely lighthearted. Its two major jury awards went to much more serious-minded films. “Alice,” Josephine Mackerras’s drama about a woman (Emilie Piponnier) who becomes a prostitute to support her child, won the narrative feature prize. And “For Sama,” which focuses on a young female Syrian filmmaker, Waad al-Kateab, who cataloged harrowing aspects of her life in Aleppo for five years, took the documentary feature award. But the festival’s biggest and funniest standouts show its programming strengths, and reinforce the value of the theatrical experience, the opportunity to laugh, and sometimes cringe, with a large, responsive audience.\n",
      "8     Give Baseball Scouts a (Perfect) 80 for Tradition One morning in February, by the back fields of the Kansas City Royals’ complex in Surprise, Ariz., Dayton Moore chatted casually with Rene Francisco. Moore is the Royals’ general manager and Francisco a top assistant, both with decades of scouting experience. Their conversation would be familiar to anyone in baseball. “I’ve never put an 80 on a player,” Moore said. “You, Rene?” Francisco shook his head. “I’m usually a 40 through 60 guy,” Moore said. “I mean, 60s plus, it’s an All-Star, so what the heck.” The banter continued like this. An outsider might have felt like a toddler trying to understand calculus. Were these people talking about numbers, players or what? “I guess a guy can be a 20 runner and a 60-70 power-production guy,” Moore said. “Usually I think the only 20 you’d ever put on a guy is the run grade — right, Rene?” Maybe, Francisco said, but what about a slow runner who still has good instincts on the bases? Moore laughed. “If you’re a 20 base runner,” he said, “hell, you probably don’t even know where first base is.” These numbers are not part of the analytics revolution that has swept baseball in the last 15 years. Quite the opposite, actually. As teams finalize evaluations for the amateur draft — which starts Monday, with the Minnesota Twins picking first — most still rely on a common and quirky scouting language that stretches back decades. Baseball scouts measure tools on a scale of 20 to 80, or sometimes 2 to 8. To baseball people, a scale from 0 to 100, or 0 to 10, would look as out of place as a pitcher’s mound in the middle of the outfield. “Eighty you’re a franchise player, 20 you’re nothing and 50 you’re average,” said Detroit Tigers General Manager Al Avila, the son of a scout and the father of a major-league catcher. “It’s always been that way.” And if it hasn’t, there may be no one alive who remembers otherwise. Art Stewart, a senior adviser to Moore with the Royals, is 90 years old, born on Babe Ruth’s birthday in 1927. Stewart took his first scouting job with the Yankees in the early 1950s, when a Pittsburgh Pirates scout showed him a numerical grading system at a spring training game in Bradenton, Fla. “That’s a funny way of doing it,” Stewart said he had thought at the time. But then, he said, he learned who had created it: Branch Rickey, the pioneering executive, who was working for the Pirates near the end of his Hall of Fame career. “Branch Rickey is the one that came up with the number system. What we have today is just a takeoff of what Rickey did,” Stewart said. “He was so far ahead of the game, it was scary.” When Stewart joined the expansion Royals in 1969, the team used a 1 to 4 scale, like a movie critic’s rating system: 4 was excellent, 3 good, 2 fair, 1 poor. But in late 1974, when Major League Baseball created a centralized scouting bureau, the 2 to 8 scale took hold throughout the game. Gordon Lakey, who started his scouting career in 1970 and now works for the Philadelphia Phillies, spent three years with the bureau in the mid-’70s. He said its first executive director, Jim Wilson, had encouraged the use of double-digit numbers — not just 2 through 8 — to further differentiate prospects. Not all teams took their reports from the bureau, Lakey said, but enough did that the 20 to 80 scale became the vernacular. Scouts judge players on a variety of tools and typically assign two grades for each, evaluating the present and the future. “Technically, you should have a lot of players in the 20s as hitters, but you can project them as 50s,” Lakey said. “You should not have many high school hitters as 50s, because you’re saying he’s an average major league hitter right now. That’s where your future grade becomes so important. It’s all about projection.” Lakey translated the numbers this way: 20 is a non-prospect; 30 is filler for a farm system; 40 is a marginal major leaguer; 50 is an average player; 60 is above average; 70 is high-impact and 80 is a game-changer, the best of the best. Usually, Lakey said, nobody whose overall grade is below 35 will ever play in the majors. Like many scouts, Lakey rarely gives 80s — though he did in the late 1970s when assessing the power of Michigan State’s Kirk Gibson, whom he saw launch a homer over a building at the University of Michigan. Gibson would go on to hit indelible World Series home runs and win a Most Valuable Player Award. Stewart, too, gave Gibson an 80 for power, and remembers also giving it to a teenage Alex Rodriguez. But the 80 grade, or an 8, is so rare that it appears on just one of the dozens of reports published in “Scouting Reports,” a 1995 book by Stan Hart; the scout Tom Ferrick gave an 8 to Delino DeShields for present and future speed. When Jeff Luhnow, now the general manager of the Houston Astros, came into baseball from the business world with St. Louis in 2003, the sanctity of the 80 grade bewildered him. “I was trying to force it into deciles — like if the scale’s 20 to 80, then there should be a certain number of major league players between 70 and 80 by definition, if each bucket is even,” Luhnow said. “Then I went back and looked at our data, and I couldn’t find any hitters that were between 70 and 80 on the hit tool. I thought, ‘Well, how can that be?’ And they said, ‘Well, an 80 is Tony Gwynn and Wade Boggs. Those guys are once in a generation.’” Initially, Luhnow said, he was struck by the arbitrary nature of using 20 as a low and 80 as a high. His bigger issue, though, was that few scouts seemed to go outside the 45 to 55 range, meaning too many prospects were clustered in the middle. Luhnow said he encouraged the Cardinals’ scouts to widen their range, but came to understand — somewhat grudgingly — the value of the scale. “I realize you can’t fight City Hall, and people have been so indoctrinated in this method of thinking about players that you have to accept it and work with it,” said Luhnow, whose Astros front office is among the most analytically minded in baseball. “And I think it actually, over the years, has grown on me,” he said. “Maybe that’s because I’ve gone native, but I do think that there’s a certain language that scouts and coaches and executives have regarding player evaluation that when you throw out a term like ‘fringy average’ or ‘plus-plus,’ as a scout you know exactly what that means, and you can sort of envision what that looks like in the player.” Billy Eppler, the Los Angeles Angels’ general manager, agreed that having a well-established scale helped when hiring scouts from other organizations, so comparisons can resonate throughout the industry. Every team adds wrinkles of its own, of course, but the basis generally stays rooted in those numbers. “Some teams will do a high risk or a low risk for every grade, like a high-risk 6 or a low-risk 5,” said Derek Falvey, the Twins’ chief baseball officer. “A guy that maybe has slightly more performance when he’s healthy or otherwise, that’s your high-risk 6. But your low-risk 5 is maybe a little bit more stable, but you’re viewing as having slightly less upside long term.” The factors that make up a final grade can be endless. A hitter with exceptional bat speed may have poor pitch-recognition skills. A pitcher who throws hard may lack the feel for spinning a breaking ball. Narrowing the numerical options, Moore said, helps eliminate confusion over just what the scout really thinks. A scale of 0 to 100 would present too many choices, and baseball, he noted, is not wedded to rounded numbers, anyway. It is, after all, a game that usually lasts nine innings, not 10. “Nothing’s 0 to 10 that I’ve ever dealt with,” said Mike Rizzo, the Washington Nationals’ general manager. “To me, it’s just a scale. You could call it red, white, blue, 20 to 80, it doesn’t matter as long as I know what a scout is saying when he says, ‘There’s an 80 runner.’” Rizzo, who has scouted for more than 30 years, said he did not hesitate to give 80s. A division rival, the Miami Marlins’ Giancarlo Stanton, has 80 power, he said, and Nationals shortstop Trea Turner has 80 speed. “What do I always say, K. K.?” Rizzo said, turning to Kris Kline, his vice president for scouting. “Hey, if he’s not an 80, why have 80s?” As for the other end of the scale, Kline — who played four years in the minors without escaping Class A — has a keen understanding. “You know what a 20 player is?” Kline asked, smiling. “A scout.”\n",

But there remained a pervasive belief, rightly or wrongly, that things have looked this bad before. That was little consolation to advisers who admitted they had no strategy for countering the news that Mr. Trump’s former fixer, Michael D. Cohen, had admitted in federal court that Mr. Trump directed him to arrange payments to two women during the 2016 campaign to silence them from talking publicly about affairs they said they had with Mr. Trump. Nor was there a plan, according to interviews with half a dozen current and former aides, to put a spin on the conviction of Paul Manafort, Mr. Trump’s former campaign manager, on eight counts of financial fraud. The only option was to follow Mr. Trump’s lead. The president, returning to a well-worn tactic of scouring media reports for any opportunity that would allow him to seize the news cycle again, decided not to cancel a planned sit-down with Fox News on Wednesday. Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary, was left to repeatedly refer to the president’s past comments on the matter. “He did nothing wrong,” Ms. Sanders said at least three times in a briefing to reporters, a sentiment that White House employees have told themselves in private conversations. “There are no charges against him.” But this time, advisers noticed that the president, a man who has in the past relished the idea of leading his troops into political battle, seemed subdued. He appeared to realize the serious nature of what had just taken place, and yet his relative calm — contrasted with his more typical lashing out when he is anxious — unnerved some of his aides. “We started with collusion,” the president mused, according to several people who witnessed Mr. Trump’s somber mood. “How did we end up here?” Well into the president’s second year, Mr. Trump’s aides have learned to weather, deflect or completely ignore developments that critics of the administration viewed as insurmountable. This spring, aides faced near constant questions about how the White House doled out security clearances. In May, the president’s personal lawyer, Rudolph W. Giuliani, said that Mr. Trump had reimbursed Mr. Cohen for payments to one of the women, Stephanie Clifford, a pornographic film actress, contradicting the president’s prior claim that he had no knowledge of them. This summer, the White House has faced a self-inflicted firestorm over its immigration policies, which led to thousands of family separations at the border; questions about why Mr. Trump stood by Scott Pruitt, the former administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, who faced more than a dozen investigations into his spending and management practices before eventually resigning in July; and Mr. Trump’s cozy, widely criticized news conference with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia in Helsinki, Finland. On Wednesday, several aides dismissed the news about Mr. Cohen as just another bad headline lacking the silver bullet that they say the special counsel would need to prove that the president conspired with Russian officials. Mr. Trump spent the early hours of Wednesday tweeting — he called the convicted Mr. Manafort a “brave man” who, unlike Mr. Cohen, “refused to ‘break’” or “make up stories in order to get a ‘deal.’’’ He also monitored headlines, as he did after his news conference with Mr. Putin. In the interview with Fox News, he asserted that money for the payments to the women had come not from his campaign, but from his own accounts. “I don’t know if you know,” Mr. Trump said during the interview, “but I tweeted about the payments. But they didn’t come out of the campaign.” Campaign finance laws still prohibit Mr. Trump from making unreported payments related to the campaign, regardless of where they came from. Neither payment was disclosed to the Federal Election Commission. On Air Force One on Tuesday night on the way back from a rally in West Virginia, Mr. Trump repeatedly minimized the news, telling aides that the legal developments were not about him, but about Mr. Manafort and Mr. Cohen. He also groused over the optics of the rally, telling a person close to him that the crowd seemed flat and that some chairs were empty. By Wednesday, Mr. Trump’s lawyers were arguing privately that Mr. Cohen’s admission and guilty plea to violating campaign finance laws was a punch but not a knockout blow, and were assessing what options they had for fighting back. They stressed that Mr. Cohen had said repeatedly in previous accounts that Mr. Trump was not aware of his payment to Ms. Clifford, known as Stormy Daniels. In an interview, Mr. Giuliani said that he had spoken at length with Mr. Trump, but that the president had wanted to move on from legal tangles to other topics — including the golf game that Mr. Giuliani was playing at a course in Scotland on Wednesday. Mr. Giuliani said the two had discussed the political fallout should Mr. Trump grant a pardon to Mr. Manafort. “Yesterday’s plea and Manafort’s conviction, none of it had to do with collusion, none of it has to do with obstruction,” Mr. Giuliani said, echoing much of what the president has said in public and in private. “He really thinks Manafort has been horribly treated.” He added that Mr. Trump’s team was looking at the possibility of making public at least one recording of Mr. Cohen speaking to journalists about his payments to Ms. Clifford, in which he said he made the payments on his own initiative to spare the Trump family pain. People who have known Mr. Trump for years pointed out that he has never been as cornered — or as isolated — as he is right now, and that he is at his most volatile when he feels backed against the wall. They pointed to his reaction after the “Access Hollywood” tape of him boasting of grabbing women’s genitals was released in October 2016. Mr. Trump responded by parading Bill Clinton’s female accusers in front of Hillary Clinton at the presidential debate in St. Louis, and acted like a man with nothing to lose. This dynamic has led Mr. Trump to publicly praise — and privately muse about pardoning — Mr. Manafort. Mr. Trump has exercised his pardon power several times since he took office, including for Joe Arpaio, the anti-immigration sheriff in Arizona, and Dinesh D’Souza, the conservative writer who was prosecuted for campaign finance violations. One official said that there was a list of people Mr. Trump has said he would like to consider for pardons or commutations, but that Mr. Manafort’s name had never been on the list. Mr. Giuliani said in the interview that a pardon for Mr. Manafort was not under consideration. Ms. Sanders said that, to her knowledge, Mr. Trump had not discussed the idea of pardoning Mr. Manafort. Several of Mr. Trump’s advisers said that he was uncertain about the political fallout and was not quite ready to do so. Mr. Manafort, 69, is in the meantime facing another trial next month on seven charges, including obstruction of justice, failure to register as a foreign agent and conspiracy to launder money.\n",

The president remained at the White House throughout, with two meetings on his public schedule for Monday: his daily intelligence briefing in the Oval Office at 11 a.m. and then, at 12:30 p.m. in his private dining room, lunch with Vice President Mike Pence. According to the White House, Trump’s Monday schedule also included phone calls to Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada, President Mauricio Macri of Argentina, and James Shaw, Jr., the hero who disarmed a gunman in a Tennessee Waffle House last month. After tweeting twice on Monday afternoon — about trade and his “personal relationship with President Xi” of China, and then about “fake news” — he boarded Marine One shortly after 5 p.m. for the trip to Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, where his wife was expected to remain hospitalized “for the duration of the week,” her spokeswoman said. “Heading over to Walter Reed Medical Center to see our great First Lady, Melania. Successful procedure, she is in good spirits,” Trump tweeted. “Thank you to all of the well-wishers!” Heading over to Walter Reed Medical Center to see our great First Lady, Melania. Successful procedure, she is in good spirits. Thank you to all of the well-wishers! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 14, 2018  Only minutes earlier, he was evidently focused on the latest damaging leaks out of the West Wing. There has been a firestorm of controversy since it was leaked last week that White House special assistant Kelly Sadler reportedly joked in a private staff meeting about Sen. John McCain’s brain cancer, saying his vote in the Senate “doesn’t matter, he’s dying anyway.” The so-called leaks coming out of the White House are a massive over  exaggeration put out by the Fake News Media in order to make us look as bad as possible. With that being said, leakers are traitors and cowards, and we will find out who they are! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 14, 2018  The president’s initial absence at his wife’s side did not go unnoticed by Twitter users including author Amy Siskind, president of women’s rights organization The New Agenda, who fired off a sarcastic tweet about the president’s “busy” schedule. First Lady Melania Trump had surgery today, but @realDonaldTrump didn’t come with her because of his busy Monday schedule. pic.twitter.com/dvSs3akNjO — Amy Siskind (@Amy_Siskind) May 14, 2018  Melania Trump has reportedly undergone kidney surgery. It’s serious enough that she’s staying in the hospital all week. And there is zero indication that Trump was there for the surgery, or even visited her yet. CNN postulated that he may go by tonight. Happy Mother’s Day! — John Aravosis (@aravosis) May 14, 2018  The president’s helicopter touched down at Walter Reed at 5:18 p.m. ET, according to a pool report. Mrs. Trump’s spokesperson, Stephanie Grisham, told PEOPLE in a statement that the first lady “is in good spirits.” And Grisham told a press pool gathered at Walter Reed: “The first lady is in good spirits and doing quite well.” According to CNN, the spokeswoman also said that the president phoned Mrs. Trump — “and they spoke extensively” — before her procedure; and he later spoke with her doctor. The president spent over an hour at the hospital visiting his wife, according to a pool report. The presidential motorcade departed Walter Reed just before 6:30 p.m. ET, under stormy conditions, to head back to the White House. It is not unprecedented for a first lady to undergo a surgical procedure without the president on stand-by in the waiting room. When Laura Bush underwent surgery in September 2007 to relieve pain from pinched nerves in her neck, then-President George W. Bush was in Australia for an APEC summit. Bush phoned his wife from his trip to check on her. REALTED VIDEO: Donald Trump Praises His ‘Incredible’ Mom on Mother’s Day But Doesn’t Mention Melania Meanwhile on Monday afternoon, as the American public reacted with surprise and concern to the first lady’s hospitalization, friends of the first couple were also taken off guard by the news. Paolo Zampolli, a UN ambassador and a longtime friend of Melania and Donald Trump’s, tells PEOPLE that after he learned of Mrs. Trump’s surgery from the breaking news, “I sent her a friendly text message, that our prayers, love and thoughts are with her and wish her a speedy recovery.” Another friend of the first couple also tells PEOPLE: “I have heard nothing about this. The first I knew was when I saw it on the news!” A third source close to the Trump family was also shocked and knew nothing of any symptoms the first lady may have had. “I had absolutely no clue this was going on,” the source close to the family tells PEOPLE.\n",

Ripa is back!   The star returned to Live! With Kelly and Michael Tuesday, taking a seat at the co-hosting desk with Michael Strahan for the first time since he announced he was leaving the morning talk show last week. Strahan, 44, revealed one week ago that he was leaving ABC’s Live! to join the network’s Good Morning America as a full time co-anchor in September.   An insider told PEOPLE last week that Ripa only found out about her co-host’s departure as the news was breaking Tuesday: “She was told at the same time as the rest of the world was learning via press release, and she was told in a room full of suits, and Strahan just sat there, mostly mute.”    Multiple sources told PEOPLE that Ripa, 45, was \"completely blindsided\" by the news and felt \"betrayed and hurt.\" In the days following the announcement, Ripa did not appear on Live!, and Strahan hosted the show with guest co-hosts Ana Gasteyer, Erin Andrews and Shay Mitchell.   “She is showing them as much respect as they showed her,” a source told PEOPLE at the time of Ripa’s noticeable absence from the show. “She knows that by not showing up she is showing the world that she is hurt and upset, and she is fine with that – she doesn’t care if people know that.”    Of Strahan, a different source told PEOPLE the former NFL pro was “hurt by her reaction, of course.”    “The very public way she’s handling this. You can’t not show up for work. If you’re going to have a meltdown you don’t do it publicly,” the source said.    Over the weekend, PEOPLE exclusively confirmed that Ripa would be back on Live! Tuesday and that the star had emailed her staff Friday evening about her planned return.   “I wanted to thank you all for giving me the time to process this new information. Your kindness, support and love has overwhelmed me. We are a family and I look forward to seeing you all on Tuesday morning,” she wrote.   On Monday, a source told PEOPLE the time off helped Ripa regroup.    “Having a few days away from things was very helpful for Kelly,” said the source. “She is glad she had the time with [her husband] Mark [Consuelos] to celebrate their anniversary and to think about things with the show.”    Another insider previously told PEOPLE Strahan was excited to have Ripa back on the show.   “He never wanted any of this to happen,” the source said. “He got why she was mad but it was out of his control. He spent the last few days reaching out because he wanted her to come back.”    “He was prepared to go on by himself if he had to, but he is relieved that it all worked out,” added the source.

Together for more than 40 years (1946 to 1987), their slow-burn silliness drew explosive laughs not through jackhammer punch lines, but with long pauses, unorthodox word choices and a total commitment to characters. On radio and television, their sly routines had none of the conventional show-business slickness, and they played to each other more than to the crowd. Stealth surrealists, they created deadpan exchanges that proved that comics could be hilarious without leaning heavily on jokes, making them the godfathers of a wide swath of alternative comedy. In their satirical focus on the absurdities of the media, Bob and Ray were also a forebear to “The Daily Show” and “Saturday Night Live.” On their NBC series in the 1950s, the comics imagined a “television referee” who would halt a terrible show the way a boxing official would call a fight. In this bit, Mr. Elliott played a hack standup comic as well as a weatherman going through the motions. On their radio show, he spoofed the mid-20th-century variety show titan Arthur Godfrey and skewered journalists with his befuddled character Wally Ballou, who reported from an Ohio paper-clip factory that cut costs by eliminating machinery and having the workers make the clips by hand. The radio show didn’t have a studio audience, and the pair’s style was conversational, pitched to a literate frequency. While they did topical material, mocking targets that are now long forgotten, many of their funniest bits are timeless comedic premises performed with amiable understatement. In one classic sketch, Mr. Elliott plays Harlow P. Whitcomb, president and recording secretary of the Slow Talkers of America, who interrupts every word with an extravagantly long pause. (It’s a premise so enduring that the trailer for the forthcoming Disney movie “Zootopia” leans on the exact same joke.) His preposterous pace sets the rhythm of this sketch; its humor is fueled by the annoyance of Mr. Goulding, who clearly wants the man to finish his thought. Instead of waiting, he tries to assist him, finishing sentences for him. The result is a kind of duel that Mr. Elliott ultimately wins by using the weapon of strategic silence. Compared with many comedy teams, Mr. Elliott and Mr. Goulding were not opposites. They shared a certain wry tone, yet Mr. Elliott was less demonstrative, an even-keeled stoic with none of the kinetic anxiety that was standard for many of the great comics of the 20th century. Whereas there is a temptation to spin an absurd situation into the realm of the grotesque, his characters remained rooted in a mundane realness that made you see the madness in everyday normality, not the other way around. A skilled ad-libber, Mr. Elliott delighted in the silliness of certain words and the power of repetition. In a bit from their 1970 Broadway production, “Bob and Ray: The Two and Only,” he plays a ridiculously dull expert on Komodo dragons who is interviewed by a man so disengaged that he keeps asking the same questions. Mr. Elliott gamely fields every one, moving around the clauses, to relay the same bland recitation of facts. Quickly, a tedious interview becomes an exhausting micro-version of the movie “Groundhog Day” in which after every question, the interview begins again. “The Komodo dragon, world’s largest living lizard,” Mr. Elliott says wearily, “is found on the island of Komodo.” Mr. Elliott’s legacy of off-kilter comedy continued with his family. His granddaughters Abby and Bridey brought a wide-eyed weirdness to sketch and movie roles, and his son Chris became a star on “Late Night With David Letterman,” performing inspired oddball characters whose chemistry with the host yielded a deft comedy team. Chris Elliott also cast his father in the early-’90s sitcom “Get a Life.” (They also wrote a 1989 book, “Daddy’s Boy,” in which every chapter written by Chris Elliott about his life was followed by his father’s rebuttal.) The popularity of Bob and Ray among the comedy cognoscenti spanned decades, from Groucho Marx and Johnny Carson (both fans) to “SCTV” and “Saturday Night Live.” (They appeared on both shows.) Mr. Elliott and Mr. Goulding never became as famous as the classic American double acts Laurel and Hardy, Abbott and Costello or Martin and Lewis — none of which lasted longer than their partnership. But they belong in that elite company, as a team whose conversations sounded so casual that you could miss how delightfully cracked they had become.\n",

'Bridgegate' defendant says he was duped NEWARK, N.J. (Reuters) - After days of complaints about traffic jams at a major New York bridge in 2013, New Jersey Governor Chris Christie’s associate demanded to know if lane closures were political retribution, he testified on Monday.  On trial over his alleged role in the “Bridgegate” scandal, Bill Baroni, Christie’s top political appointee at the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, said he confronted fellow authority executive David Wildstein to ask whether the lane closures in September 2013 were an act of retribution against the Democratic mayor of a commuter town.  “I said, ‘David, tell me right now, is this true?’” Baroni testified in federal court in Newark, where he is on trial on fraud charges. “He looked me in the eye and said, ‘Absolutely not.’”  In his first day of testimony, Baroni asserted that Wildstein orchestrated the lane closures without his knowledge to punish Mark Sokolich, the mayor of Fort Lee, for his refusal to endorse Christie’s re-election bid.  Baroni also rejected Wildstein’s contention that they discussed the scheme with Christie as it was unfolding.  Christie had soared to national prominence in late 2012 for his response to Superstorm Sandy and wanted to use that spotlight, and an aura of bipartisan spirit, to catapult himself towards the White House. But the scandal hurt his image and his campaign ultimately collapsed early this year, though he has always denied involvement.  Baroni’s story was entirely at odds with the narrative U.S. prosecutors have presented at trial. They have accused Baroni, Wildstein and former Christie deputy chief of staff Bridget Kelly of conspiring to create the traffic jam to punish Sokolich.  Kelly, on trial alongside Baroni, is also expected to testify. Wildstein has pleaded guilty and appeared as the government’s star witness earlier in the case.  Baroni said he confronted Wildstein after receiving a letter from Sokolich suggesting the closures had “punitive overtones.”  But during cross-examination, Assistant U.S. Attorney Lee Cortes pointed out that days before, Sokolich left him a voicemail asking “who’s mad at me?”  “So the first time you heard from him, he was asking if someone was mad at him? It wasn’t Thursday?” Cortes asked.  Baroni said he believed Wildstein’s representation that the George Washington Bridge lane closure was part of a traffic study and that he should not respond to Sokolich.   “I’ve regretted it ever since,” Baroni said.  Wildstein said he and Baroni invented the traffic study as a cover story.  Reporting by Joseph Ax; editing by Scott Malone and Cynthia Osterman\n",

The recommendation comes as the country’s civil aviation regulator ANAC has announced it will take back the slots held by grounded airline Avianca Brasil in the airport, known as Congonhas, as part of a plan to redistribute them later.   Under current rules, many of the slots would go to the two airlines that already control most of Congonhas’ flights: Gol Linhas Aereas Inteligentes  and LATAM Airlines Group .   The antitrust regulator, known as CADE, wants the rules changed to favor potential new entrants, increasing competition, according to a legal recommendation made public on Monday.   The Brazilian government recently enacted a law that allows foreign-owned carriers to operate domestic flights in Latin America’s largest air market, which could unleash new competition for the Congonhas slots.   The timing is significant because Congonhas slots are not normally up for grabs. But Avianca Brasil’s financial crisis has changed that landscape. Formerly Brazil’s No. 4 airline, the carrier has been grounded since May following a bankruptcy filing and the progressive reduction of its operations.   Its financial struggles set off a fierce battle over who would inherit its slots, particularly in Congonhas and the domestic airport in Rio de Janeiro. Brazil’s top three airlines, Gol, LATAM and Azul SA, had all expressed interest in the slots, and spent millions in efforts to secure them.   Avianca Brasil had planned to auction the slots on July 10, in hopes of raising at least $140 million for its creditors. But with ANAC’s decision to recall the slots, it is unclear whether the auction will still take place.  A representative for Avianca Brasil did not have immediate comment.

Crude inventories rose 2.1 million barrels in the week to April 15, compared with analysts’ expectations for an increase of 2.4 million barrels. Crude stocks at the Cushing, Oklahoma, delivery hub for U.S. crude futures fell 248,000 barrels, EIA said. Brent and U.S. crude futures both rose after the data, with Brent reversing losses and turning positive. [O/R] “Distillates are the standout bullish element of the report and gasoline is the disappointment,” said Matt Smith, director of commodity research at New York-headquartered energy data provider ClipperData. “Distillate throughput jumped last week, meaning demand is only down 0.7 percent on the 4-week moving average.” Distillate stockpiles, which include diesel and heating oil, fell 3.6 million barrels, versus expectations for a 304,000-barrel increase, the EIA data showed. “This pocket of demand might be a bright spot in terms of helping to sop up some of the global glut of diesel,” said David Thompson, executive vice-president at energy-specialized commodities broker Powerhouse in Washington. Gasoline stocks fell 110,000 barrels, far less than the 1.2 million-barrel drawdown forecast. Refinery crude runs rose 163,000 barrels per day, as utilization rates inched up 0.2 percentage point to 89.4 percent of total capacity. U.S. crude imports rose 247,000 bpd. “PADD 3 crude stocks unchanged on a modestly large reduction in imports into P3 and a reduction in run rates in P3,” said Dominick Chirichella, senior partner at the Energy Management Institute in New York.

(Reuters) - A low interest rate environment sets limits on what the Federal Reserve can accomplish with monetary policy, making it important for the Fed to “proactively” cut rates when risks appear to provide a buffer for the economy, Chicago Fed President Charles Evans said Wednesday. Evans said that when inflation is low, providing “too much accommodation” can help the U.S. central bank reach its inflation target sooner. In contrast, not acting strongly enough can cause inflation expectations to be anchored at low levels. “In my view, these differences mean we need to err on the side of providing aggressive enough accommodation to get inflation moving up with some momentum,” Evans said at an event hosted here by the Greater Peoria Economic Development Council. Speaking to an audience of local politicians and business leaders, Evans stressed the importance of responding quickly to downside risks, making the case that the Fed could raise rates later if needed. “Engineering a modest overshoot of our inflation objective better guarantees that we would actually meet our inflation target in the future,” Evans said. “Any excessive overshooting could be controlled with modest rate hikes.” Evans supported the two interest rate reductions approved by the Fed in July and September and said Wednesday that he thinks monetary policy is “probably in a good place right now.” The U.S. central bank’s target rate is now at a level between 1.75% and 2.00%. Last week, Evans said he would go into the Oct. 29-30 meeting “open minded” about to whether rates should be adjusted in either direction. Investors are widely expecting officials to cut interest rates by a quarter of a percentage point at the October meeting. Evans said he expects the U.S. economy to grow by above 2% this year and pointed to healthy consumer balance sheets and a strong labor market as bright spots. Still, he said that uncertainty over trade policy and a slowdown in global growth have led to a decline in business investment. “There is some risk that the economy will have more difficulty navigating all the uncertainties out there or that unexpected downside shocks might hit,” Evans said. “So there is an argument for more accommodation now to provide some further risk-management buffer against these potential events.” Evans said in an interview with reporters that the need for monetary stimulus could decline if there are positive developments in some of the conflicts threatening to slow the economy, including the trade war with China and Britain’s exit from the European Union. The policymaker also said that Fed officials are still evaluating solutions for improving liquidity in money markets and studying why reserves are not circulating within the banking system. The Fed announced last week that it will purchase $60 billion in short-term Treasury bills a month to bring the reserves in the banking system back to about $1.5 trillion, or the level seen in early September before there was a spike in borrowing rates for cash. Evans said that financial regulations, such as Dodd Frank, have changed banks’ demand for reserves and stopped some banks with excess reserves from lending out the cash. “It’s not just the level of reserves,” he said. “A second dimension to that is reserves are concentrated in a small number of the larger banks, and what is their appetite for arbitraging repo rates against other rates when they have regulatory requirements. The entire market functioning has changed over the last 15 or more years.” Evans said he is “open minded” to the possibility of a standing repo facility, an approach that officials discussed in their June meeting that would allow financial firms to borrow cash at a fixed rate. But he said Fed policymakers still need to discuss how such a program would be structured and if it is needed to improve access to liquidity. “I think we might struggle with this longer than we would like,” he said.

Last week De Benedetti, a veteran of the Italian business scene who chaired GEDI (GEDI.MI) for a decade, offered to buy a 29.9% stake as part of a two-stage relaunch plan. At the same time, he launched a blistering attack on his sons Marco and Rodolfo who have run the publisher of the La Repubblica and La Stampa newspapers for the past seven years. After launching the bid, De Benedetti told the Corriere della Sera newspaper that his sons had “neither the skills nor the passion required to be publishers” and had concentrated solely on looking for a buyer. “The interview contains an attack on my brother Rodolfo and myself, a subject that is painful for us, which is on a personal level and on which I do not wish to comment”, Marco De Benedetti wrote in a letter sent to staff on Monday. “We are not a wreck of a group, we do not need to be restructured, we are not a rudderless ship,” he added. The dispute between De Benedetti and his sons has transfixed corporate Italy, combining family drama with a battle to control some of the country’s best known newspapers, which like their counterparts across the world have struggled to meet challenges from social media and declining advertising revenues. Earlier on Monday, the publisher reported a sharp decline in net profit in the third quarter to 0.7 million euros from 3.5 million euros ($3.91 million) a year ago and said it did not expect any significant changes in market trends for the full-year. The company’s shares fell almost 9% after the results before trimming losses to close 6% lower. In a statement accompanying the results, GEDI’s board said it was taking appropriate measures to face challenges in the media sector. “The GEDI Group maintains a solid leadership in daily newspapers, digital media and radio, and adopts measures capable of facing the future, investment and development, and creating sustainable value”, it said. De Benedetti transferred his stake in holding company CIR (CIRX.MI), which controls nearly 43% of GEDI, to his three sons, Rodolfo, Marco and Edoardo, seven years ago but has been disappointed by the group’s performance since. Edoardo does not hold an executive role. De Benedetti’s plan envisages strengthening the company’s management and investments in digital. A subsequent step would see him handing his shares to a foundation — including journalists, managers and individuals from the cultural sectors — and convincing other shareholders to do the same, he told Corriere della Sera last week. De Benedetti took a stake in centre-left daily La Repubblica soon after it was launched in 1976 and was associated with the newspaper for decades. GEDI, which emerged from the L’Espresso group behind La Repubblica, merged with the publisher of the Turin daily La Stampa in 2017. Exor (EXOR.MI) the holding group of Italy’s Agnelli family has a stake of nearly 5% in GEDI, according to the latest Consob filings.

Its shares fell 46 percent to $2.16. Falling demand for coal, tougher environmental controls and cheaper natural gas have pushed several big coal miners, including Arch Coal Inc ACIIQ.PK, into bankruptcy in the past year. Peabody, which flagged the possibility of bankruptcy under the \"risk factors\" section of a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, said it had decided to skip $71.1 million in interest payments, kicking off a 30-day grace period. (1.usa.gov/22jEJnJ) The company, said there was “substantial doubt” about its ability to continue as a going concern. It cited stagnating economic growth in major coal importers and the potential for additional regulatory requirements imposed on producers. Coal prices TRAPI2Yc1, which hit historic highs above $200 per tonne in 2008, now trade at around $40 a tonne. Goldman Sachs Group has said coal would never gain enough traction to lift it out of its slump. The U.S. Energy Information Administration on Wednesday forecast that this year will be the first year that natural gas fired generation exceeds coal generation on an annual basis. About a third of U.S. electricity comes from natural gas, versus 32 percent from coal and 19 percent from nuclear. As recently as 2000, coal accounted for about half. St. Louis-based Peabody, which employed 7,600 people on Dec. 31, said it was also looking into other sources of capital to support its needs for cash and keep it in compliance with creditors. Bond exchanges, cost cuts and waivers to its credit agreements are some of its options, the company said. Peabody owns interest in 26 mines in the United States and Australia, with about three-quarters of its output going to U.S. electricity generators, according to its filing. It has trading and business offices in Australia, China, and India, among others. China, where coal imports have slowed to support domestic producers, represented 7.1 percent of total Peabody sales last year. On March 11, Peabody reported $900 million of cash and cash equivalents. It had reported $261.3 million in cash and cash equivalents at Dec. 31, and then, in February, borrowed the maximum amount available under its revolving credit line, about $945 million. The company said in a statement its auditors have concluded its current financial path may not be sustainable and “may result in an acceleration of our debt obligations.” Peabody had total debt of $6.3 billion at the end of 2015. Peabody’s lenders are pushing it to restructure its debt through bankruptcy. Peabody’s efforts to raise funds through asset sales hit a roadblock last month. A deal to raise $358 million in cash by selling coal mines in New Mexico and Colorado was temporarily shelved after the buyer failed to secure financing. Peabody’s shares have crashed from their record high of more than $1,300 in 2008 to $2.36 on Wednesday morning. Its market capitalization was $74 million Wednesday, down from over $20 billion in 2008, according to Thomson Reuters data. Fellow coal miner Foresight Energy LP (FELP.N) said on Tuesday it may file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy if it does not reach an out-of-court restructuring agreement with its lenders. Patriot Coal Corp, which was spun off from Peabody in 2007, filed for bankruptcy protection in May 2015, just 18 months after emerging from its previous Chapter 11. Other coal miners that have filed for protection include Walter Energy WLTGQ.PK and Alpha Natural Resources Inc WLTGQ.PK. Cloud Peak Energy Inc CLD.N, Consol Energy Inc (CNX.N), Foresight and Westmoreland Coal Co WLB.O were all lower by about 1 percent in midday trading on Wednesday. \n",
      "19    Facebook Wants You To Embrace 'Social VR' (and Forget About Palmer Luckey) Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg took to the stage in San Jose, California yesterday to give the world a peek at the future of the world's most popular social network: the intersection of virtual reality, video chat, and the clunky Facebook website that we're all used to. This was the opening of Oculus Connect 3, the third annual gathering of developers working with the Oculus Rift VR headset, the parent company of which Facebook purchased in 2014 for $2 billion. Notably absent from the proceedings: Palmer Luckey, Oculus's 24-year-old co-founder, who was recently exposed by The Daily Beast as a funding source for a group dedicated to posting anti-Hillary Clinton memes online. Still, at Oculus Connect 3, the show went on. Zuckerberg and his colleagues were outfitted with Nintendo Mii-esque avatars around a table, playing card game and goofing off, setting up a couple themes that were present throughout the event: VR for non-gaming uses, and VR as part of a community, as opposed to the user shuttering themselves inside their own world. The latter included products like Haromonix's Sing Space, a karaoke video game that allows you to play against friends online, as well as Oculus's own \"Parties\" and \"Rooms.\" According to an Oculus press release, Parties allow you to make a voice call with up to eight people \"from anywhere in VR,\" while Oculus Rooms, hang out with friends in VR, watch movies together in the VR space, or launch games. Both ship \"in the coming weeks.\". But the centerpiece to the Oculus Connect 3 keynote on Wednesday was the unveiling of the Oculus Touch controller, available for $199 when it launches on December 6th. The controller, which comes as a set of two, each have a camera for hand tracking purposes, and are designed to make hand positioning more comfortable, and allow for more natural movement and pointing inside virtual reality games and programs. In concert with the $599 Oculus Rift headset package, an Oculus system is now competitive with the $799 HTC Vive, which also ships with motion controllers, though an additional $79 sensor is needed for the Oculus setup to achieve \"roomscale\" experiences. On top of that, Oculus announced a $499 gaming PC that's specced to be ready for its software, down from the $800-$1,000 range that previous Oculus-ready PCs occupied. There was emphasis on the accessibility of the price points throughout, even for the company's new $49 earbuds. Oculus CEO Brendan Iribe stressed the value, saying that they sound as good as $900 earphones, which remains to be seen. Developers weren't left out of the fiscally-themed announcements, as a new perk was announced for those producing apps for Oculus. The 5 percent royalty fee charged by Epic Games for using the wildly popular Unreal Engine will be covered entirely by Oculus for each game's first $5 million of gross revenue. Titles coming for the Touch/Rift combo include 4A Games' \"Arktika.1, a shooter set in a \"frozen dystopian future,\" Ready at Dawn's \"Lone Echo,\" a \"high fidelity\" adverture game based in outer space, and Epic Games, \"Robo Recall,\" a first-person shooter with \"creative combat tactics.\" No release date was given yet for these games. There was a heavy emphasis on the company's investments as well. Oculus says that it has put $250 million into VR content so far, with another $250 million coming in the near future. Notably, the company also says it will commit $10 million to new diversity programs and \"continue our investment in programs like Launch Pad, VR for Good, Amplified New Voices, and new programs like the Diverse Filmmakers Project,\" with that last one launching today. The diversity announcements come just two weeks after the initial report from The Daily Beast on Luckey's funding of the \"alt-right\" group Nimble America, which he later admitted to in a Facebook post. Motherboard soon discovered that this shouldn't have been a big surprise, given Luckey's history of \"liking\" various \"alt-right\" Tweets, a list of which are available as long as you don't have a protected Twitter profile. In the days since then, various VR developers have come out saying they won't be developing games for the Oculus platform due to Luckey's activities, instead choosing alternatives such as HTC's Vive, with some calling for Luckey to step down from the company. However, Oculus and Facebook appear to be attempting to repair their image among VR devs. According to the Oculus release, \"this new program will fund and support women and people from underrepresented groups to help accelerate production of their VR films -- from 360 documentaries to interactive experiences made for Touch.\" Get six of our favorite Motherboard stories every day by signing up for our newsletter. \n",

The sale to the U.S. health insurer is the culmination of a months-long auction process, WSJ said.  It is likely that UnitedHealth would merge Equian into its Optum unit, it added.  “We don’t comment on market rumors and speculation,” a UnitedHealth spokesman told Reuters.  Equian did not respond immediately to a request for comment.     UnitedHealth on Wednesday won the Federal Trade Commission’s approval for its acquisition of DaVita Inc’s  primary and urgent care unit, which will be rolled into the company’s Optum Unit.

The yield differences between Treasury Inflation Protected Securities and regular Treasuries, or inflation breakeven rates, are seen as a proxy of investors’ inflation expectations. The 10-year TIPS breakeven rate was a tad higher from late Monday at 1.60 percent, holding above its lowest level in three weeks, according to Tradeweb data.

The settlement includes a fine of 4 million Swiss francs, out of a maximum of 5 million, as well as gross profit plus interest it gained from oil deals in the two west African countries in 2009-2011 worth hundreds of millions of dollars. The decision is the first time in Switzerland that a major trading firm has been found guilty on such charges, Swiss campaign group Public Eye said. It published an investigation into the deals in 2017. “The Geneva commodities trader has been convicted of failing to take all the organizational measures that were reasonable and necessary to prevent its employees and agents from bribing public officials in order to gain access to the petroleum markets in the Republic of Congo and Ivory Coast,” a statement from the Swiss Attorney General’s Office said. Gunvor, one of the world’s top energy traders, said in response to the ruling that there was “no conscious or desired involvement of employees or members of management in these activities”. It added that no current employees or businesses of Gunvor Group were involved in any related ongoing litigation or investigations. The Attorney General (AG) began a money laundering probe in late 2011 into unknown individuals that grew over the years. It began investigating Gunvor as a company for organizational deficiencies in 2017. A former employee, Pascal Collard, signed a plea deal in 2018 in which he admitted paying bribes to win contracts for the firm. He said senior management was fully aware and approved the transactions, according to a Swiss prosecution document. As a result of the payments, Gunvor secured a three-year oil supply contract from Congo state oil firm SNPC in June 2010 and signed two deals to make prepayments for oil cargoes with SNPC worth $125 million and $500 million in July 2011. The firm also received Ivory Coast oil cargoes between 2009 and 2010. The bribe recipients, according to the plea deal, included Congolese President Denis Sassou Nguesso, his family members and former senior Ivory Coast government officials. The Congo government denied the allegations. In a recent interview, Gunvor Chief Executive Torbjorn Tornqvist said the process “was very painful ... I promised my employees, stakeholders and my family that we will never find ourselves in this position again”. Swiss prosecutors said Gunvor had no code of conduct, compliance or sufficient oversight at the time. The firm has since built up a compliance scheme and reduced the number of intermediaries and agents it uses to secure deals by a third. The settlement amounts to about 3% of total trading profit for the firm between 2009-2011, Gunvor said. It had put aside funds last year in case of a financial settlement with Swiss authorities.

Merkel is under heavy pressure at home to do more to tackle Europe’s migrant crisis, which has seen some 1.1 million people, including tens of thousands of Iraqis, arrive in Germany over the past year seeking refuge from wars and poverty. The chancellor said Germany had not earmarked the credits for any particular purpose but said Iraq needed to rebuild its war-shattered infrastructure to give its citizens hope and to encourage them to remain in the country. As well as the slump in oil prices, Iraq is also battling Islamic State militants who control swathes of territory in the north and west. Iraq, whose income comes almost exclusively from oil sales, is struggling to pay its bills . The 2016 budget projects a 24 trillion Iraqi dinar ($20.45 billion) deficit financed largely by aid from international organisations such as the World Bank. Baghdad is expected to need hundreds of millions of dollars to repair infrastructure in cities recaptured from Islamic State with the help of airstrikes from the U.S.-led coalition, of which Germany is also a member.
